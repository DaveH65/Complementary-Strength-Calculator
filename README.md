# Complementary-Strength-Calculator

Just a cool little calculator that I frequently love to use. Use this if you are a nerd for numbers and enjoy working out. For example, say you are bored and on your phone after your set, and want to see how your current bench press would transfer over to a dumbbell bench press. This is the place for that!! Some neat features include, 1rm calculator, how your 1rm stacks up to other lifters, and how to rectify imbalances if you know your 1rm for both complementary lifts.

Thank you,
